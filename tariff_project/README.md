# Trump Tariff Rate Predictor Project

A fun school Machine Learning project to predict the rate of a tariff given certain input features in a dataset entry (such as trade deficit, export, imports, population, etc.).

## Data Source

This dataset was sourced online via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/trump-tarrif-data/data). Since this exercise is for the sole purpose of practicing learned machine learning concepts towards a relevant project, this repository holds no claims to the accuracy of the data.

## Included Files

- `project.ipynb`
  - The Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning algorithms employed in the analysis.
- `tariff_data_cleaned.csv`
  - The CSV file containing the data after cleaning it. Generative AI was employed in the process of cleaning the data, and it was verified for accuracy by randomly selecting columns of the data and manually comparing its contents to the original dataset.
