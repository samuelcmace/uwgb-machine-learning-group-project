# Vehicle Accident Likelihood Predictor Project

A machine learning school project to predict the likelihood of a vehicle accident occurring given certain input features (such as the location, time of day, etc.).

## Data Source

This dataset was sourced online via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/trump-tarrif-data/data). Since this exercise is for the sole purpose of practicing learned machine learning concepts towards a relevant project, this repository holds no claims to the accuracy of the data.

## Included Files

- `project.ipynb`
  - The Jupyter notebook containing the machine learning algorithms employed in the analysis.
- `accident_prediction_india.csv`
  - The CSV file containing the data as it was retrieved from the Kaggle website.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the data is already mostly cleaned, depending on our analysis, we may have to clean it further in the future. However, this will more-likely happen after we get deeper into the project.
