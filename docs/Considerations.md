# Machine Learning Final Project Considerations

As part of the requirements for presenting the project, our team was tasked to consider the following requirements for completing the project:

## Evaluation Rubric (Out of 100 Points)

| Category | Points |
| - | - |
| Problem Definition | 10 |
| Dataset Understanding & Preprocessing | 10 |
| Model Choice & Justification | 10 |
| Evaluation Metrics | 10 |
| Performance & Results | 10 |
| Visualization & Interpretation | 10 |
| Code Quality & Reproducibility | 10 |
| Critical Thinking (Limitations, Improvements) | 10 |

## Project Evaluation Questions

1. Is the problem clearly defined and relevant?
2. Did the team explain the dataset origin and structure?
3. Was the data cleaned and preprocessed correctly?
4. Are appropriate models selected for the task?
5. Is the training and testing process properly explained?
6. Are performance metrics (accuracy, F1, etc.) correctly computed?
7. Is the model performance reasonable given the problem?
8. Did the team attempt hyperparameter tuning or improvement?
9. Are visualizations (confusion matrix, loss curve) included and explained?
10. Is the code organized, documented, and reproducible?
11. Are limitations or errors discussed?
12. Was the presentation clear and engaging?
13. Did the team demonstrate a strong understanding of ML concepts?
