## Project 1: Trump Tariffs

**Project Name:** Trump Tariff Rate Predictor. We will input features about a given country and its trade deficit to predict what Tariff rate Trump will impose. ðŸ˜³

**Team Members:** Samuel Mace and Trenton Weyland

**Dataset:** The [Trump Tariff Dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mesumraza/trump-tarrif-data/data). Although it is likely this was official data released by the White House, we cannot confirm the true source of the data. However, for the sake of this learning exercise, the data doesn't need to be 100% accurate to serve as a humorous final project.

**ML-Model Name:** We plan to use the decision tree regressor for this project. However, we may also play around with the random forest regressor if time permits.

**Model Evaluation Technique:** Since the simple train-test split was the most-popular evaluation technique shown in the zyBooks exercises, we are little more-familiar with this technique. So, this is what we have decided to use for this project.

## Project 2: Accident Reports in India

**Project Name:** Vehicle Accident Likelihood Predictor. We will leverage a history of vehicle accidents in the country of India to predict the likelihood that another accident will occur given different features (time of day, time of year, location, etc.).

**Team Members:** Samuel Mace and Trenton Weyland

**Dataset:** The [India Road Accident dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khushikyad001/india-road-accident-dataset-predictive-analysis) was also found on Kaggle in the trending dataset category. According to the link, the data was sourced the following way:

> Synthesized from multiple real-world datasets, including the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) reports, Open Government Data (OGD) India, and accident statistics from various Indian states.

**ML-Model Name:** We plan to use Support Vector Machine (SVM) for this project. We plan to use a linear kernel for the project, and may experiment with other kernels if time allows.

**Model Evaluation Technique:** Similarly to the other project, we will use a train-test split to evaluate the performance and accuracy of our model.
